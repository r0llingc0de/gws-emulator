# 2014 Genesys Hackathon

## Overview

GWS (Genesys Web Services) Chat API is a REST API which is to be used in a chat tool/widget for end-users of customer-centric companies.  Genesys’ goal is to “Save the world from bad customer service” and as such we want to enable our customers to easily interact with their end-users and increase their brand satisfaction.   

You have seen many different Chat Widgets in action on many different websites.  Our API provides just such a functionality.  A user comes to a website and has an option to chat with an Agent about a problem or a question that they may have. 

## Ideas

1. Software (tool) for custom chat widget creation.  Think of a WYSIWYG tool that allows one to create a code-snippet which can be used on a website and will serve a chat ui for a visitor to the said website to get help from an agent.  Such tool should allow full customization of variables, fonts, wait time before chat pops up, greetings, logos, images, location of send and get transcripts buttons, logo location, etc.   The team that creates the most creative tool to create widgets with most and easiest to use customization choices could get lots of points awarded.  A ground rule for output of the tool is that a business user (non-programmer, caveat: programmers should be able to use this too) that is a consumer of the software presented can use it to generate the chat widget that they would like the look and functionality of.
   * Output is a WYSIWYG and a widget (javascript, html, css, images, etc).  A completely custom layout should be supported
1. Integration of Chat API with theUBI.
1. Chat API in-app integration with some Android, iOS, Windows 8 apps.
1. Anything else - use your imagination.

## Judging Criteria

There are a total of 3+3+6+7+5+5+6 = 35 points that a judge can award to the team. Team with most points will win.

1. **Originality.**  How original is the software presented.  Is it just like everything else or is it pretty unique.   1-3 points.  You will be awarded 3 points for a very original idea.
1. **Functionality.**  Does this software do what you say it does?   1-3 points.  If your software does everything that you say it does you will get 3 points.  Judges will deduct points if some of the things you suggested it does do not work or are not complete.
1. **Quality.**  Is the deliverable working well or was it buggy.  How is the performance, is the software fast or laggy?  1-6 points.  You can get lots of points for delivering software of good quality.  We might not be checking your UnitTests but we expect that you cover your bases with ample testing and show-off a quality product.  6 points for ZERO defects.
1. **Technical difficulty.**  How difficult do judges believe this software was to create.  1-7 points.  Was integration of some of the APIs challenging?  Did you have to do something very cutting edge.  You can score up to 7 points for an ambitiously chosen path.
1. **Use of the API or JS Library (client).**  Was the API used properly, creatively and extensively. 1-5 points.  Plain and simple, use the API/JS Library and use it correctly and you shall be awarded up to 5 points.  Functionality will be demo’d by performing a real customer to contact center chat.  This is nearly a freebie, but you still have to earn it.
1. **User Experience (UX).**  Does this software present a good and user friendly user experience? Would you say it was easy and pleasant to use?  1-5 points. Ever used a software that was easy and a pleasure to use?  We all have.  You shall get 5 points for a very nice User Experience.
1. **Wow factor.**  One could argue that Wow factor is similar to originality, however, when presented with a cool concept or software it is fairly easy to assign WOW points.  1-6 points.  This is almost a bonus.  Impress the judges and get these extra points to give you a lead in the race to own one of the google glasses.
